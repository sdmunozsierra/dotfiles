# dotfiles
Contain my .config files for many Linux programs

## File Structure
All "dot files" are in the folder config.
TODO separate bash, vim, and gtk outside dotfiles to folders for simplicity

## OUTDATED!!

## (NEW SECTION) ArchScripts
These are basically scripts that will install everything I need if I screw up my machine (which is something very probable due to my humanity).
As right now all of them do what they are called to do install_* (install something)

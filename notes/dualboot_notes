When doing a dualboot with windows and linux system take this notes as a reference:
*Always install first windows.
Because youre a control freak and probably you will like to have partitions
for everything, remember that sometimes windows installs the boot in the
HDD2 instead of the SDD, in that case you need to reinstall windows and
leave the boot partition on the SDD. See tutorials for that or windows will
fail to boot.

If that happens, which happened to Kanue..

Erase boot partition on hdd and boot into the windows USB an use boot repair
and I dont know how but vuala.
